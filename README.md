# Crop_Disease_Detection

Developed a Deep learning neural network model to detect and classify different types of crop disease from images, utilizing 4 distinct diseased affected crops. Implemented the model to process input data, effectively distinguishing different diseases with test data, achieving a test accuracy of more than 89.2% in test data by using a pre-trained deep learning model(Efficeint Net) and also tried to train model by using other or different pre-trained model like RESNET and then finally comparing the result and performance of each models for selecting the best model. Demonstrated the model's capability through significant performance metrics such as accuracy and loss during training and evaluation phases.
